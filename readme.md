This is my assignment of Advanced Pattern Recognition.

I took breast cancer dataset and did classification using Logistic regression and support vector. Also tried using linear discriminant analysis but there is a slight decrease in accuracy because initial no.of features were 30 and after LDA we get only 1 feature. So there is loss of information and therefore slight decrease in accuracy.
